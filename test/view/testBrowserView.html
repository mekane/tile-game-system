<h1>Browser View Test</h1>
<p>The purpose of this html page is to do a simple test of whether the browser view is properly loading and rendering
    on the page and reporting browser events. Its responsibility is to turn a game state into html elements and to send
    browser events back to the handler.</p>

<h2>Verify Rendering</h2>
<p>
    The view should render a grid between the two horizontal rules below:
</p>
<hr>
<div id="browserViewHere">RENDER FAIL</div>
<hr>

<h2>Verify Events</h2>
<p>
    An abstracted version of browser events will be reported in the browser console. Open it and use the arrow
    keys to verify that messages show up for each keypress.
