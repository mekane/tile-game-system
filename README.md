# Architecture

This system is organized according to the 
[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
and takes a good amount of inspiration from the [Dev-Mastery Example Project](https://github.com/dev-mastery/comments-api)
and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnailTcJV_U). 

See the README in _engine_ for more details on each part.
